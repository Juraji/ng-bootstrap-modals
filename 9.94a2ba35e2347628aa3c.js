Direct access to the modal component's instance to inject data (inputs).\n2. No clear separation in api of how a modal was completed (dismiss or resolved)\n3. The use of entry components\n4. Modal components use DI injector of the module where they were spawned.\n\nThis library tries to fix these issues by merging NG Bootstrap's implementation with the one from [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/).\n1. It uses (encapsulated) DI injector to pass settings and data to the hosted modals\n2. The `ModalRef` now has the following outputs:\n    * `onResolve: Observable<T>` emits and complets when the modal resolves with a value.\n    * `onDismiss: Observable<void>` emits and completes when the modal is dismissed by the user pressing escape, clicking the close button or outside the container.\n    * `onComplete: Observable<void>` emits and completes on resolved and dismissed.\n3. You no longer need to export your modal component as entry component. The way of constructing components is completely different.\n4. Injection is now inherited from the module which exports the component. \n\n## Installation instructions\n\n### Preconditions\nPeer dependencies:\n* @angular/common: `^11.2.1`\n* @angular/core: `^11.2.1`\n* @angular/animations: `^11.2.1`\n* bootstrap: `~4.5.0`\n\n### Github packages\nYou will need to authorize to Github packages for the `@juraji` scope.\nIf you have never done this before, read up on [Configuring npm for use with GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages).\n\nJust for reference, here's what my `.npmrc` looks like:\n```\n@juraji:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/\n//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=MY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\n```\nThe above configuration is the same for NPM and Yarn.\nIt will route NPM and yarn to only use Github packages for the `@juraji` scope.\n\nFor more information on Github personal access tokens check [your developer settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).\n\n### Installation\n\n1. Install `@juraji/ng-bootstrap-modals`.\n    * For Yarn use `yarn add @juraji/ng-bootstrap-modals`.\n    * For NPM use `npm install @juraji/ng-bootstrap-modals`.\n2. Add `ModalModule.forRoot()` to your root module.\n3. Use the `Modals` service to open components as modals.\n\nFor examples visit [the demo site](https://juraji.github.io/ng-bootstrap-modals)!\n"}}]);
